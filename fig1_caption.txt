Figure 1: Living vs Dead Proportions – Training Data vs Unconditioned Generation (Random Dataset)

This bar chart compares the percentage of ‘Live’ and ‘Dead’ final boards between:
- **Training data** (N = 4 000 boards at threshold 0.05)
- **Unconditioned samples** (N = 1 000 generated boards with no class input)

Axes:
- **X-axis**: two categories, labeled “Live” (boards with ≥1 surviving cell) and “Dead” (boards that died out). Tick positions at x=0 (Live) and x=1 (Dead).
- **Y-axis**: “Percentage of Boards” ranging from 0 % to 100 % (major ticks at 0, 25, 50, 75, 100).

Elements:
- **Gray bars** at x=0 and x=1 show training data percentages; **Blue bars** at x=0.4 and x=1.4 show model output.
- Bar width = 0.4 for both series.
- Exact percentages printed above each bar (e.g. “17.00 % (680/4000)”).
- Δ% annotation between each pair: (model% – data%)/data% × 100 labeled in smaller font above.
