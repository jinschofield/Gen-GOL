Figure 3: Effect of Conditioning on Live/Dead Balance – Random Dataset

This grouped bar chart compares the proportions of “Live” vs. “Dead” final boards under three sampling modes:
- Unconditioned (gray): N = 1 000 boards sampled with no class label.
- Conditioned → Live (green): N = 1 000 boards sampled with a “live” condition (c = 1).
- Conditioned → Dead (red): N = 1 000 boards sampled with a “dead” condition (c = 0).

Axes:
- X-axis: two categories, “Live” (x = 0) and “Dead” (x = 1).
- Y-axis: Percentage of boards (%) from 0 % to 100 % (ticks at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100).

Bars:
- For each category:
  • Gray bar at x – 0.3 (Unconditioned)
  • Green bar at x       (Conditioned Live)
  • Red bar at x + 0.3   (Conditioned Dead)
- Bar width = 0.25.
- Each bar is annotated with absolute count (e.g., “820/1000”) and percentage (e.g., “82.0 %”).
- Δ% labels above each conditioned bar indicate relative change vs. Unconditioned: (cond% – uncond%) / uncond% × 100.

Legend:
- Gray = Unconditioned
- Green = Conditioned Live
- Red = Conditioned Dead
