Figure 5: Conditioning Effects on Quota-Trained Model – Output Distribution by Class

This grouped bar chart shows the percentage of boards assigned to each outcome class under two sampling modes:
- **Unconditioned** (gray bars): N = 1 000 boards sampled with no conditioning.
- **Conditioned on class** (colored bars): N = 1 000 boards sampled with the specified target label.

Categories (X-axis at positions 0–4):
1. All Living
2. Still Life
3. Oscillator (Period 2)
4. Other Life
5. Dead

Axes:
- **X-axis**: Five discrete ticks labeled as above; tick labels rotated 45° if needed.
- **Y-axis**: “Percentage of Boards” from 0 % to 100 % (major ticks every 20 %).

Bars:
- **Gray** bar at each category = unconditioned sample proportion.
- **Colored** bar at same category = conditioned sample proportion. Colors: 
  - All Living = green
  - Still Life = teal
  - Oscillator P2 = orange
  - Other Life = purple
  - Dead = red
- Bar width = 0.35.
- Percentage value (e.g. “80.0 % (800/1000)”) printed atop each bar.
- **Δ%** annotation above each colored bar: (cond% − uncond%) / uncond% × 100, formatted “+10.0 %”.

Legend:
- Gray = Unconditioned
- Colored = Conditioned on Class
