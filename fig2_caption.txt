Figure 2: Distribution of Life Subtypes – Training Data vs Unconditioned Generation (Random Dataset)

Shows relative frequencies of final-state categories:
1. **Still Life**
2. **Oscillator (Period 2)**
3. **Other Life** (multi-cell survivors beyond P2)
4. **Died Out**

Data:
- **Training set**: 4 000 Board samples at threshold 0.05
- **Unconditioned gen**: 1 000 samples from diffusion model

Axes:
- **X-axis**: Four discrete ticks for each subtype; labels rotated 45°.
- **Y-axis**: “Percentage of Boards” from 0 to 100 with grid lines at 20 % increments.

Bars:
- **Gray** bars (left) = Training, **Blue** bars (right) = Model.
- Bar width = 0.35, centered per subtype at x positions.
- Percent values atop bars (e.g. “25.50 %”).
- Δ% printed between pairs in italics.
