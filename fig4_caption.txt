Figure 4: Outcome Class Distribution – Quota Training Data vs Unconditioned Generation

This grouped bar chart shows the percentage of each outcome class in:
- **Quota training dataset**: 5 000 Game of Life boards (1 000 each of Still Life, Oscillator P2, Other Life, Dead, plus All Living = sum of all live classes).
- **Unconditioned generation**: 1 000 boards sampled from the diffusion model with no class label.

Axes:
- **X-axis**: Five categories at x = 0…4 labeled “All Living”, “Still Life”, “Oscillator P2”, “Other Life”, “Dead”.
- **Y-axis**: Percentage of boards (0 %–100 %) with ticks every 20 %.

Bars:
- **Gray bars (left)**: training data percentages.
- **Blue bars (right)**: model output percentages.
- **Bar width** = 0.35.
- Exact percentages (e.g. “20.00 %”) and raw counts (e.g. “200/1000”) annotated above each bar.
- **Δ% labels** above paired bars: (model% – data%)/data% × 100, formatted “+5.0 %”.

Legend:
- Gray = Quota Data
- Blue = Unconditioned Samples
