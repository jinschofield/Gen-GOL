Figure 8: Cosine Similarity Heatmap of Class-Conditional Embeddings

This heatmap visualizes the pairwise cosine similarity between the learned FiLM-layer embedding vectors for five classes:
- **Live**
- **Dead**
- **Still Life**
- **Oscillator (Period 2)**
- **Other Life**

Axes:
- **X-axis**: Class labels (ordered as above), tick positions 0–4, displayed at the bottom.
- **Y-axis**: Class labels (same order), tick positions 0–4, displayed on the left.

Color Scale:
- Continuous gradient from –1.0 (dark blue) to +1.0 (dark red), with 0 at white.
- **Colorbar** on the right labeled “Cosine Similarity”, with major ticks at –1.0, –0.5, 0, 0.5, 1.0.

Annotations:
- Each cell (i, j) shows the exact cosine similarity value, formatted to two decimal places (e.g., “0.85”).
- Diagonal entries are +1.00 by definition (self-similarity).

Plot Details:
- **Figure size**: 6″ × 6″.
- **Font**: Times New Roman, size 12 for labels, 10 for annotation text.
- **Grid**: light gray lines separating cells.
